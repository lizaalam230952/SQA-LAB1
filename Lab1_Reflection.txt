In this lab, I learned how Git and GitHub help manage QA artifacts professionally. 
Version control ensures accountability and traceability by recording who made changes and when. 
GitHub supports collaboration by allowing multiple team members to work on the same repository and track updates in real time. 
This setup will help maintain organized and controlled QA documentation throughout the semester.
